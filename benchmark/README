    • 700 were selected based on ProtCID
    • 977 were selected based on QSalign

Folder content:
benchmark_pdb_format/ contains unedited PDB format for QSalign structures, PDB format generated by ProtCID for other structures.

benchmark_mmcif_format/ contains unedited CIF format for QSalign structures, CIF format generated by ProtCID for other structures.
