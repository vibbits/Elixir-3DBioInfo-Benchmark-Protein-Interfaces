Two scores, ITScorePP1 and DLScoreBC, were used to rank the complexes in the dataset respectively. ITscorePP is an atomic-level, statistical potential-based scoring function for protein-protein interactions developed by our lab using an efficient iterative method based on the crystal structures of heterodimeric protein complexes. DLScoreBC is an in-house developed deep learning model for classification of biological and crystal interfaces. DLScoreBC was generated based on the intermolecular contacts of a previously established dataset by combining Convolution Neural Network (CNN).
