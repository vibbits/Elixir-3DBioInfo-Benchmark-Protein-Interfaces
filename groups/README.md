Contains the folders of all the participating groups, as well as the results from AlphaFold calculations.

The folders of the participants are organized as follow:

- **results-raw** contains a csv file with the different raw scores of the participants applied on the benchmark.

- **results-classifier** contains a csv file with the different integrated scores of the participants applied on the benchmark.

Rk: not all groups applied integrated scores on the benchmark, therefore the folder results-classifier can be absent for some groups.

Each folder also contains a documentation made by the participants describing the raw and integrated scores they applied on the benchmark.
